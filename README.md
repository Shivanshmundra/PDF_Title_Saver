# PDF_Title_Saver
Save your pdf files with their corresponding title 

### Why?
I was frustrated when every research paper I downloaded saved with some corresponding index numbers which makes it difficult to navigate. This code save every pdf with their best suited title.

### Requirements

1. pdftitle install with `pip install pdftitle`

Usage example: python3 save_title.py --folder ~/papers_I_read
